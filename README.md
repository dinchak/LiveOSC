LiveOSC
=======

MIDI remote script for communication with Ableton Live over OSC

This is the recommended version of LiveOSC to use with node-liveosc.  This version has been modified to use ports 9005 and 9006 and has a few new OSC callbacks and bug fixes.  I am not the original author of this code, the original version can be found here:

The author recently announced LiveOSC2 which will be used instead when it's ready:
